- Tests: unit tests, etc
-- testdata => serialize a schedule to a file (let's just xstream dump it)
-- just testing the solver?
(-- test the jaxrs calls with arquillian maybe? or cargo? or soapui?)... Still thinking about what would be the best solution for this



- Add JPA (matyas)
-- Refactor String id to String externalId - FINISHED
-- Add numeric id which is the database id - FINISHED
-- hsql with example datasource - FINISHED
-- auto-generate tables => "just works" - FINISHED
-- optimistic locking - introduced @version column - FINISHED
-- annotate relationships with proper jpa @OneToMany, @ManyToMany, @ManyToOne - FINISHED
-- add proper constraints to fields other than @Column, for instance field level validation, and null constraints - FINISHED, UNTIL I NEED TO RELAX OR TIGHTEN SOMETHING 
-- add @Json annotations to prevent circular references - FINISHED

- extra constraints (ge0ffrey)
-- Add domain + constraint + CRUD for SpeakerTimeslotUnavailability
-- Add domain + constraint + CRUD for prepareTime for certain Talks. (for example to set up the robots that they'll be showing)
-- Add domain + constraint for language "en", "fr", etc
-- other constraint on ge0ffrey's list
-- ConferenceParametrization object

- Multitenancy or multiple conferences
-- refactor rename Schedule to Conference - FINISHED
-- Add a String name to Conference - FINISHED
-- Opening screen: list of conferences (if a conf is imported multiple times, it shows up multiple times)
-- and a button "new conference" => from scratch or import (from devoxx BE or FR or ...)

- Async solving on a separate thread (copy paste from VehicleRoutingSolverManager)
-- take bestSolutionChange event and push that back to the client via a websocket


Phase 2: a viable reference app that "optimize a conference schedule" = minimal marketable feature

- What if multiple conf schedules solve at the same time etc.

- Deploy on openshift

- Authentication / authorization (Keycloak - SSO of google, openid, etc)

- Marketing: Markus (Javaland) and Stephan (Devoxx)


Phase 9

- Integration with? lanyrd - fosdem's schedule - ...
